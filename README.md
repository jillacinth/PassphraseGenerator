# PassphraseGenerator
	This project aims to develop and analyze a novel approach for creating secure, memorable passwords by leveraging passphrase suggestions using a Large Language Model (LLM). Components of the project will include LLM output analysis, prompt engineering, and statistical analysis. The project will include the design and development of a web application where users can generate secure passphrases based on a unique prompt-response system. Our objectives are to assess the usability, security, and time required to compromise such passphrases using statistical and practical techniques, and to demonstrate the projectâ€™s feasibility and effectiveness in a comprehensive final report and presentation.
	The proposed schema has an LLM that generates randomized security questions unique to users creating an account. The user takes their responses and concatenates them into a passphrase. The passphrase is hashed and stored along with the cleartext security questions. For user login, the questions are again presented, allowing them to recall their passphrase. This schema should solve the issue of users using the same passwords for multiple sites, is phishing resistant, and eliminates the need for a password manager.
	This project leverages LLMs to address limitations of fixed security question systems by generating unique, personalized, and unpredictable prompts that are challenging to exploit with traditional guessing or pattern-based attacks. Unlike conventional methods, the dynamic nature of LLM-generated questions reduces the likelihood of users receiving identical prompts or using repetitive answers across multiple accounts. No user input is going to be processed by the LLM. Users will independently concatenate their responses into a passphrase, ensuring that the LLM never has access to the actual passphrase. This design separates the generation of prompts from the creation and storage of passphrases, enhancing security and privacy. The current design will use our inputs to generate questions. We may modify this at a later time by allowing users limited inputs, such as selecting from a fixed list of hobbies for more personalized security questions.
