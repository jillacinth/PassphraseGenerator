# PassphraseGenerator
## Patrick Krawczyk and Jillian Jacinto
This project aims to develop and analyze a novel approach for creating secure, memorable passwords by leveraging passphrase suggestions using a Large Language Model (LLM). Components of the project will include LLM output analysis, prompt engineering, and statistical analysis. The project will include the design and development of a web application where users can generate secure passphrases based on a unique prompt-response system. Our objectives are to assess the usability, security, and time required to compromise such passphrases using statistical and practical techniques, and to demonstrate the projectâ€™s feasibility and effectiveness in a comprehensive final report and presentation.
